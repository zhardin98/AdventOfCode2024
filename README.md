# Advent Of Code 2024
This repo holds my solutions for AOC 2024, using COBOL.

prompts: https://adventofcode.com/2024

Note: I have the solutions in individual directories because when I work on it, I will compile a unique .exe to run with the 
unique input data in a .txt file. Based on my preference to not upload executables to GitHub and the AOC rule about uploading
their data, these will not be visible and thus are in my gitignore.
